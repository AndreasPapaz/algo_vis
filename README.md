### Binary Tree Insert (search Node in code)

Practice with a single p5.js web page. Each user input will store a `Node` in the `Tree`
that is stored on the browser client. Only Numbers will be able to be stored
and a `Node` will be created.

This was Practice with JavaScript and creating a Binary Tree with methods
(`prototype` functions) to insert, traverse, and search
